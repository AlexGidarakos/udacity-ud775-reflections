What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates a hidden .git directory. I need to do it because otherwise Git would not be able to distinguish between plain system directories and Git repositories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a temporary and dynamic construct to help Git decide what it should do when the next commit occurs.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    I can use the git diff --staged command to make sure that my next commit will contain only one logical change
