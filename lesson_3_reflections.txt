When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to collaborate with other people or when I want to decentralize my code base and work from multiple machines/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there may have been some serious changes on the remote by other collaborators.
