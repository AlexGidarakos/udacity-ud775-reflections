When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to collaborate with other people or when I want to decentralize my code base and work from multiple machines/locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there may have been some serious changes on the remote by other collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forking is an internal GitHub operation. Cloning creates a local copy of either a local or a remote repository. Branching creates an alternative branch on a local repository.
